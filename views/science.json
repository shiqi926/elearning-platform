Force is defined as a push or a pull. Another example of force is an applied force. It occurs when a person or thing applies force to an object. Force can cause an object at rest to start moving. Forces can cause objects to speed up or slow down. Forces can cause a moving object to stop. Forces can also cause a change in direction. In short, forces cause changes in motion. The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both. "

				"target": "#Friction",
				"define": "Friction is a force that works against motion. It occurs between two surfaces that are touching. Friction can be good and bad. How can this be? Think about some common things we do. For example, we put rubber tires on our cars. The tires cause friction against the road. Without rubber tires, the car would slide around. Think about the bottom of your bathtub. Do you have tape that has a sandy texture? Maybe you use a rubber mat. Both materials prevent you from slipping. If you live in a really cold place, you have probably seen icy sidewalks. Perhaps you have put sand on the frozen surface. The sand increases friction. It helps to keep you from slipping and falling. Is friction always a good thing? "

If you lift a book, it moves upward. Now, imagine you drop a ball. It falls to the ground. Can you see the force pulling it down? That is what makes gravity really cool. It is invisible. Invisible means you cannot see it. But wait, it has even more surprises."

It uses minerals from the soil, sunlight, and water to make its own food. As the plant grows, it begins to look like a small copy of the adult plant. Over time, it gets larger. It eventually becomes an adult plant. It will produce seeds or spores, which will someday be the start of a new plant. "

For most insects, they go through four stages. The first stage is the egg stage. In the second stage, they hatch as insect larva. The larva then matures. Next is the pupa chrysalis stage. After this final stage, the insect will look like its parents. This change is called a complete metamorphosis."

Some animals hatch and do not need care from their parents. They are ready to live on their own. Other animals will still need the care of their parents. Sea turtles break out of their shells. They immediately walk to the ocean. They do this with no help from an adult. Birds stay in the nest for many weeks. They are cared for by their parents. They leave the nest when they are strong enough to fly. Some animals give birth to live offspring. Animals like horses, cows, and whales give live birth. Their offspring are born looking like mini adults."

When work is done, energy is transferred. This transfer occurs between one object and another. For example, a batter swings a bat and transfers energy. She transfers her energy to the bat. The moving bat, in turn, transfers energy to the ball. Energy is measured in the joule (J)."

Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction."

First, you must know how far something travels. Second, you need to know how long it takes to travel that far. Speed can be calculated using this formula: speed = distance / time"
